PROBLEM STATEMENT-
According to the National Mental Health Survey conducted in 2015-16, it was estimated that around 15% of the Indian population, or approximately 197 million people, had some form of mental health condition.
There is a significant stigma around people suffering from mental health issues. They are often tagged as "lunatics," "crazy," "possessed," and many more by society. This leads to a vicious cycle of shame, suffering, and isolation for the patients.


<h3>Mental Health Awarness</h3>
<p>Mental health awareness is an important issue that involves recognizing and understanding individuals' mental health challenges. It involves educating oneself and others about the signs, symptoms, and treatment options for mental health disorders and reducing the stigma associated with seeking help for these conditions.

Mental health issues can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status. Some of the most common mental health disorders include anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. It's important to note that mental health disorders are medical conditions, and like other medical conditions, they require proper diagnosis, treatment, and management.

Mental health awareness involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable discussing their concerns and seeking help when needed. This can be achieved through education campaigns, mental health screenings, community outreach, and other initiatives to promote mental health awareness and reduce stigma.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a mental health issue, it's important to seek professional help. Mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed counselors can provide diagnosis, treatment, and support for various mental health issues. Additionally, several resources are available for individuals and families affected by mental health disorders, including support groups, online forums, and crisis hotlines.</p>
