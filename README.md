PROBLEM STATEMENT-
According to the National Mental Health Survey conducted in 2015-16, it was estimated that around 15% of the Indian population, or approximately 197 million people, had some form of mental health condition.
There is a big stigma around people suffering from any kind of mental health issues. They are often tagged as “lunatics”, “crazy”, “possessed” and many more by society. This leads to a vicious cycle of shame, suffering and isolation of the patients.


<h3>Mental Health Awarness</h3>
<p>Mental health awareness is an important issue that involves recognizing and understanding the challenges that individuals face with their mental health. It involves educating oneself and others about the signs, symptoms, and treatment options for mental health disorders, as well as reducing the stigma associated with seeking help for these conditions.

Mental health issues can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status. Some of the most common mental health disorders include anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. It's important to note that mental health disorders are medical conditions, and like other medical conditions, they require proper diagnosis, treatment, and management.

Mental health awareness involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable discussing their mental health concerns and seeking help when needed. This can be achieved through education campaigns, mental health screenings, community outreach, and other initiatives aimed at promoting mental health awareness and reducing stigma.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a mental health issue, it's important to seek professional help. Mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed counselors can provide diagnosis, treatment, and support for a wide range of mental health issues. Additionally, there are a number of resources available for individuals and families affected by mental health disorders, including support groups, online forums, and crisis hotlines.</p>
